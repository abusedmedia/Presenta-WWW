        <h1>Build <br />presentations <br />the modern way.</h1>
        <h3><strong>PRESENTA</strong> is an online tool that helps to design and build effective presentations in seconds.</h3>
        <p>Since it's not yet another PowerPoint/Keynote tool, here some of its core principles to get the picture:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on constraints, not unlimited possibilities.</li>
            <li>Focused on content-first principle.
            <li>It's a system that assists with sensible defaults.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>PRESENTA</strong> focuses you on creating great content, not moving pixels (an activity that can be automated).
            It takes some decisions for you, enforcing best practices to produce professional presentations.</p>
        <p><strong>PRESENTA</strong> allows great <em>look&feel</em> even though the constraints.</p>
