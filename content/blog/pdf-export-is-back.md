As promised in the last [update recap](/blog/presenta-update-01), the PDF export capability of **PRESENTA** is back and running now. 

This means you can save any presentation as a static, high-fidelity, PDF file for sharing or backup purposes.

The export feature will preserve all the look&feel of the presentation as well as all the active links. This is an interesting feature already described [here](/blog/how-to-include-videos-).

The next iteration of the exporter will allow to save as PDF just a selection of slides, an handy possibility to export quickly excluding some slides or considering just a section of a lengthy presentation in the PDF file.

Stay tuned, or better yet, register an account to receive such notification as well.
