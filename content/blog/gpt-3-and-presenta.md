We started to integrate **GPT-3** form **OpenAI** into **PRESENTA** because we believe that **Automation** and **Personalization** are the future of a biog part of online communication.

**PRESENTA** is able to generate media assets (images) on-the-fly using a wide array of information in real-time.

**GPT-3** is a Text-to-Text generation model we can use to create information out of simple human-written questions.

This opens up a wide array of possibilities in image generation field.

Today we've integrated **GPT-3 Davinci-003** Model into **PRESENTA**:

In this example GPT-3 generates a famous quote alongside its author and a color. PRESENTA then uses these information to produce an-always-different image on-the-fly, ready to be published somewhere.

We'll continue to experiment with edge technologies in **PRESENTA** making more proof-of-concept out there.

Stay tuned!
