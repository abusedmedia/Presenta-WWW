This is a free to use and modern dynamic social preview image for generic website posts.

A social preview image is an important component of any marketing strategy. People are used to share contents on social media platforms, and the preview of the content is key to maximize audience engagement.

<div class="img">

</div>

While most publishing platform, such as Wordpress, allows to set an image for each article, such this example:

<div class="img">

![](../blog/covers/tc-og.png)

</div>

It's still not ideal since it's quite generic.

By using this a PRESENTA dynamic template, you are adding in-context preview to your audience without even thinking about.

The process of image generation is completely automatic.
Once you'll add the template URL into your open-graph tag, every time someone share your content, a in-context graphic image will be used.

Just put this URL in your Open-Graph tags alongside the custom parameters and you'll get your personalized social preview image in seconds:
