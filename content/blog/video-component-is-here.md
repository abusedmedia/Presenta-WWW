**PRESENTA**, so far, suggested to use external video services to include video assets in presentations. There are many benefits using them in this so always-connected world.

Nevertheless, there are situations where you cannot rely to such services or want to use your own videos for some reasons.

Starting from the **Candidate Release 1.0** it's possibile to upload and use your own video files in **PRESENTA**.
