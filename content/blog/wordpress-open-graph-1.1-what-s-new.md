We've just updated our [Open-Graph Wordpress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/presenta-open-graph/) to generate beautiful social preview images automatically.

## What's new

We've updated the service end-point, more fast and reliable than ever.

Then, we've added more beautiful templates ready to be used with one click.

Here a sneak peak of the admin interface:

As usual, the setup is ridiculous. Choose the template and you're set!



## It's Free!

It's completely free and the image contains a little watermark to advertise the service. We're planning to add a Premium capability in the near future to remove it and unlocking other features.

You can download the plugin from [WordPress.org page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/presenta-open-graph/).
