Our [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/PresentaSw) is configured to publishing social media post automatically in order to advertising our [Figma Open-Graph templates](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1176431749719792877) used by our [Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/presenta-open-graph/).

There are currently **20 templates**, so we wanted to create **20 tweets variations** and let the bot publishing them on a specific interval of time.

The image variations are easy because **PRESENTA** platform is designed for doing specifically that task.

We need also a text variation because 20 post with the same text is not great.

## Entering ChatGPT 

We think [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) doesn't need any introduction since it was a blast.

This is how we used it to create 20 variations of a given sentence in seconds. 

We've prompt the following text:

```Write 20 variations of this sentence: Free Open Graph template for effective social sharing```

And here the magic:

and here one of the published tweet:

We believe **automation** and **generated content** with a **personalized** touch will be the **future** of **marketing** communication. Of course novel and brilliant ideas are required, that's the human job.
