**PRESENTA** is an online platform that automates the production of digital documents such as **PDF** and **images**.

It allows to configure **graphic templates** in order to use an **API infrastructure** to generate variants **at scale**.

One of the most obvious context of use is in the **image personalization** for **marketing and communication purposes**.

## Transactional email

Transactional emails are those sent to specific users, on specific events with the purpose to notify/inform/reply to them, such as:

- Account alerts (signup, forgot password, etc)
- E-commerce notifications (shipping, order, etc)
- General communication (support request, feedback, etc)

Since they are sent to specific people, there's a huge opportunity to provide more personalized content to them in order to gain more engagement.

**PRESENTA** can help in this context creating a dynamic image that is personalized using some user-related information (merge-tags). The integration is dead-easy in every email platforms since it provides an **image URL**.

## Newsletter email

Newsletter emails are those sent to targeted audiences, on regular schedule or on specific moment with the purpose to engage them with relevant content, such as:

- Tutorials, guides, articles
- News on products/services
- Promotions, opportunities

They are sent to an audience, for this reason having the possibility to differentiate each email with a personal touch automatically is great to increase the engagement.

**PRESENTA** can help in this context too by creating a dynamic image that is personalized using some user-related information (merge-tags). The integration is dead-easy in every email platforms since it provides an **image URL**.

## Social Sharing Preview

The social sharing preview (or open-graph image) is the image shown by social networks when someone share a specific URL. 
It's a great tool to increase user engagement because an image is way more powerful and attractive than plain text. But a single image for every page underpowers the tool.

**PRESENTA** can help in this context creating a dynamic image for each webpage automatically using some page-related information (i.e. title, date, author, etch). The integration is dead-easy since it provides an **image URL**.
