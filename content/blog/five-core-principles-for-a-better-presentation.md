[David JP Phillips](https://www.davidjpphillips.com/) is a well-known presentations expert, speaker, and consultant that helps companies presenting and speaking better and more efficiently.

In one of his famous TED talk is possible to grasp some useful principles to make a presentation *great* and *efficient*. 

Here a summary:

- Use **one message** per single slide
- Prefer **images** rather than text as much as possible
- **Font size** should be set according to the importance of the text
- **Contrast** is a powerful tool to draw attention and easy readability
- Lower the **number** of items/object per single slide, six is the magic number. The rule is: the reader doesn't have to count those elements, just looking at it to know that number

A rule of thumb, you, as a presenter, are the **main actor**, the presentation should be less visible and important than you, ever.

**PRESENTA** wants to be the next-gen tool to make effective presentations in no time because you can spend your time building great content!

It follows some core principles to foster **content-first**, enforcing **best practices**, trying to make a cut from the Powerpoint legacy.
