Showing **data** and **charts** in a presentation is a good way to **convey bold messages** to an audience. 

Charts, when appropriate in a given context, act as meaningful images. They are powerful.

## Let's use Datawrapper

**PRESENTA** doesn't have internal tools to build charts yet, but we can use some external services!

[Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) is a wonderful (*free* and *premium*) online service that let you configure interactive charts with ease. If you have some data, with Datawrapper you can get a meaningful visual representation of them with interactive capabilities.

**PRESENTA** allows embedding [external](/blog/how-to-include-videos-in-pdf-presentation) resources and a Datawrapper chart makes no exception.

It's just a matter of copying the embed code from your Datawrapper chart:

Then, include it in PRESENTA:

You can preview it by selecting its slide, adjusting also the background color and padding as well:

And you can present **interacting with it** during your presentation:

You can only imagine **how powerful** your speech can be with such capability!
