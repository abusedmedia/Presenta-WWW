In previous versions of **PRESENTA**, the only way to include Youtube videos was by [using the Embed module](/blog/how-to-use-video-in-presenta/).

While it's still a working route, it has some usability issues.

Starting from the **version 1.0**, a Youtube video can be included using its dedicated module that adds improvements in the following areas:

- **a faster inclusion**, just pasting the video URL, thus, you don't need to dig the embed code up
- **an easier playback control**, using the keyboard, a more natural approach than clicking the video controls
- **a definive fix** for the [focus issue](/blog/how-to-use-video-in-presenta/) with embeds

By using this module you can continue to benefit the capability of the embed code:

- you can use **unlisted** (meaning private) videos in your presentations
- Youtube videos will be 'printed' in the PDF document out of the box alongside its link
