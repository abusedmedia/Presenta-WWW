title: Learn more about the Frame Format

When creating a new project in **Presenta**, the default value of the **Frame Format** is 16/9. 

That means the ratio between width and height is 16/9, which is the typical value for presentations on full-screen in a full-HD display.

Of course, you're able to override it by operating on two different levels:

- Choosing a different preset from the list of common aspect-ratios
- Setting explicitly the Width and Height

In **Presenta**, the Frame size is ephemeral. The only important setting is the aspect-ratio, also known as the proportion between width and height.

Indeed, by setting the **Width** and **Height** parameters, they are used only to compute the corrent aspect-ratio of the **Frame**.
