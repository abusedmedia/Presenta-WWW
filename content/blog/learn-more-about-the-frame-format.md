When creating a new project in **Presenta**, the default value of the **Frame Format** is 16/9. 

That means the ratio between width and height is 16/9, which is the typical value for presentations of full-screen proportion of a full-HD display.

You're able to override it by operating on two different levels:

- Choosing a different the preset from the list of common aspect-ratios
- Setting explicitly the Width and Height

In **Presenta** the Frame size id ephemeral. The only important setting is the aspect-ratio also known as the proportion between width and height.

Indeed, by setting the Width and Height parameters, they are used only to compute the right aspect-ratio of the Frame.
