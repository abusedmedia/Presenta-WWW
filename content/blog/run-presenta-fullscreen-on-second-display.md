If you are on MacOsX, chances are that a default setting of **Mission Control**, together with a MacOsX bug, prevents displaying the main screen (becoming full black) when running the PRESENTA presentation window in fullscreen on a secondary monitor.

This is not a PRESENTA issue and it can be solved quite easily by following this tutorial related to the Mission Control preference.

#### Open Mission Control preference panel from MacOsX Preferences:

#### Enable the "Displays have separate Spaces" checkbox

That's is. 

You need to log-out and log-in again from MacOsX to take effect.

Now you can run a **PRESENTA** presentation on secondary display and having the editor visible on your main screen to help your speech as well.
