[In this video, from 2008](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFDm1-DVdyc&feature=youtu.be), **Garr Reynolds** explains the **good** and the **bad** asking the audience their memories about presentations they've seen in the past.

The point Garr wanted to highlight was to support his principles about presenting information in public, that were:

- Simplicity
- Restraint
- Naturalness

A lot of interesting insights from the audience, though, asking to (and engaging) them:

### What's bad:

- clip-arts
- too much text
- forced to read slides
- missed the point
- unecessary animations
- bad colors and contrast
- the presenter faces the screen
- too much cluttering

### What's good: 

- Engagement
- Interacting with the audience with questions/answers
- Storytelling
- Personality
- Good pacing, a balance between fast and slow

It's so great to see how **PRESENTA** is aligned with those principles and suggestions.
