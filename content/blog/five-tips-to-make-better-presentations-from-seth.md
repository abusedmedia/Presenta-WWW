In this [short post](https://seths.blog/2018/07/generous-assertions/), Seth Godin gave some hints about creating better presentations.

While they are hints to improve public speech, they are valuable also for presentation documents as well.

### Make it shorter.

Time is precious therefore saving some of it is valuable. The same principle can be applied making documents that don't consume audience time more than the necessary.

### Donâ€™t use slides as a teleprompter.

This is good advice. A slide should empower the presenter. A good slide should dialogue with the presenter.

### Be here now.

This is connected to the way a presentation document should be crafted. The personality and the personal presence matter. All these things cannot be substituted by a bunch of slides. A presentation document is a tool to enhance a personal presentation, not the other way around.
