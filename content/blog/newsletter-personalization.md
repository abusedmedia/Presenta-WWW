To add a personal touch to commercial email, there isn't a better way than adding an engaging image that **looks designed for every specific user**.

With **PRESENTA**, you can design and configure a dynamic image that **gets rendered on-the-fly** when a specific person open her own email. The image can be personalized with some parameters, from your audience database, you can pass alongside the image URL.

Usually, a newsletter is sent by specialised tools such as **MailChimp** or **MailJet**. 

If you're using other tools, don't worry, almost any newsletter tools out there are compatible as well. The only requirements are:

- Support for merge-tags (or dynamic tags)
- Support for basic HTML snippet or IMG tag





















## Let's create your first dynamic image for newsletters

The first step is to design the template. You can use [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (and use its incredible community resources) to do it. There's a [quick guide](/blog/figma-to-presenta-getting-started) on how to do it properly.

Let's find some inspiration from the Figma community:

Adapt with our purpose:

The next step is to import the Figma template into **PRESENTA**:

Here the template converted, ready to be published as dynamic URL:

Now it's time to publish the URL and test the parameters:

The template is ready to be integrated into your newsletter tool. Before that, you need to fill the PRESENTA Template URL with the dynamic tags that come from your newsletter tool of choice:

Now, grab the URL and paste it into your newsletter template:

And here the MailChimp integration using the HTML block:

In case you're using MailJet instead, here the equivalent integration with its own merge tag syntax:

You've done. All the people that will receive and open their email will get a personalized, on-the-fly generated image!
