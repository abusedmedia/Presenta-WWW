**AI**, besides being a great tech, is a buzzword.

When there’s a buzzword around, companies tend to use it to provide a better picture of their product/service.

In other words, they want to fool us a little bit.

 **AI** is no exception and we can see tools out there advertising their magnificent incorporated intelligent technology and how it can help the end-users.

There are even some presentation tools that claims they use **AI** to make effective presentations.
To be fair, it does require 30 seconds to understand that said **AI** is just bullshit.

What they call **AI** is, in reality, a shuffle between a bunch of hand-made presets. That’s it.

**PRESENTA** follows some principles (that eventually will be drafted in a Manifesto post) and one of those is:

> The no-bullshit principle

Meaning, we don’t want to fool the users with some buzzwords that look smart and innovative (but in reality they are not).
We don’t want doctoring features for the shake of an actual trend.
In simple terms, we don’t want to tell you bullshits.

The time **PRESENTA** will incorporate **AI** capabilities it will be real **AI** for a real requirement.

Right now, **PRESENTA** is a tool (slowly) designed with care with the aim to be useful for real without fooling anyone.
