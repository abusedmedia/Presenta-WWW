A common technique in SaaS world is to **collecting emails** of potential interested users before the tool is publicly available.

This is a smart move to create an initial batch of **early adopters** ready to be invited once the tool will be ready for them.

That day will come eventually and we'll have to **invite those users** for an early signup, usually by means of a email campaign.

Engaging users in every possible communication is key for any marketing strategy. Let's try to **be creative** in this very specific interaction point.

## A personalized banner

Collecting emails usually is not enough. Most of the time, alongside the email, we ask, at least,for name and surname.

Let's try to use those information in a creative and nice way.

## Design the banner

We start with a screenshot of a checkbox list. We want to inform the user that they have been selected for early signups.

<div class="img">

</div>

## Test it

The Text Block element is the only dynamic element in the template that will be filled with the firstname and lastname of the user:

<div class="img">

</div>

## The dynamic tags

In this example we'll use Mailchimp as an email sender for our campaign, but any modern email senders has the possibility to add dynamic tags (merge-tags in Mailchimp lingo):

<div class="img">

</div>

## The email integration

Since the banner is just an URL, you can easily integrate in any email editor:

<div class="img">

</div>

## The result

From now on, it's just a regular email campaign, here the result:

<div class="img">

</div>

## Conclusion

**PRESENTA** integrates nicely with any marketing and communication tools since it provides just an URL for your personalized campaigns.
