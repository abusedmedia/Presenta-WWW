**PRESENTA** exists because of a dream. It wants to be a tool to:

> help people presenting great.

But that simple principle involves a tremendous amount of rethinking about how a tool can facilitate that outcome.

We believe in the **less-is-more** principle, therefore, removing is way more helpful than adding possibilities. The *balance* between what you can do and don't is the real challenge.

## Adding content

**PRESENTA**, now in public beta, offers a way to add only three types of contents:

- Text blocks
- Images
- Embedded web objects

You can combine the text with the images and the embeds using some layout options. Text cannot be dense nor lengthy. You are forced to be **concise**, you are encouraged to put only the **core elements** to represent your *message* or your *story*.

In PRESENTA each slide serves a **specific purpose**, which is about representing a concept that you are going to describe to your audience.

## Text blocks

A text in PRESENTA can be formatted with a subset of typical options. Having hundreds of text possibilities is not relevant when conveying a message. We think the actual options are enough for many communication purposes.

## Images

You can add one or multiple images that are laying out automatically. There will be more options on that because now is very limited.

## Embedded web objects

You can add external embed objects (let's say, a Youtube video is an embed) that are handled the same way as an image. In the future, there will be some built-in objects to solve specific needs (for instance, charts).

## The battle

The real battle is happening in the design phase (which is never done), the decisions that shape the meaning of the tool.
