In **PRESENTA** the first-citizen view is the grid layout rather that the common sidebar+canvas provided by all the other popular tools such as Powerpoint, Keynote and Google Presentation.

There a reason for that: 

> having a clear overview of the whole is much more meaningful than a partial representation.

A presentation document is a sequence of concepts and each slide serves a specific purpose in a defined context.

The bird-eye view is also well supported by the way **PRESENTA** display texts (less and bigger) giving the possibility to constantly reviewing the whole flow of the document, reading chuncks of text here and there.

We believe the **PRESENTA** default slide view is a better tool when building a presentation than a slide-focussed view of other common tools.

We know, it's something the others don't do, but there's a very dangerous saying, you know? "we always do it that way".
