In **PRESENTA** the first-citizen view is the grid layout rather that the common sidebar+canvas provided by all the other popular tools such as Powerpoint, Keynote and Google Presentation.

There's a reason for that: 

> having a clear overview of the **whole** is much more meaningful than a *partial* representation.

A presentation document is a **sequence of concepts** and each slide serves a specific purpose in a given context.

The bird-eye view is also well supported by the way **PRESENTA** display texts (**less** and **bigger**) giving the possibility to constantly reviewing the whole flow of the document, reading chuncks of text here and there.

We believe the **PRESENTA** default slides view is a better tool when building a presentation than a single slide focussed view of other popular tools.

We know, it's something the others don't do, but there's a very dangerous *saying*, you know? "we always do it that way".
