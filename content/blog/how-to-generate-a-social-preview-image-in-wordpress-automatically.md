We've just launched the initial version of our first **WordPress plugin** to exploit **PRESENTA** capabilities directly in WordPress sites.

It's called [PRESENTA Open Graph](https://wordpress.org/plugins/presenta-open-graph/) and its purpose is to **generate a social preview image on the fly automatically** for every post/page in a WordPress website.



<div class="img">

The setting page is pretty simple. 

- choose the template you like the most.
- review a couple of settings according to your WordPress installation

That's it and you're all set.

## Templates

Right now it comes with a bunch of templates but we're adding more and more based on people feedback.

## It's Free!

It's completely free and the image contains a little watermark to advertise the service. We're planning to add a Premium capability in the near future to remove it and unlocking other features.

You can download the plugin from [WordPress.org page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/presenta-open-graph/).
